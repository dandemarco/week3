                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>The game presents the player with 2 definitions. The player must guess the word being defined. The player can ask for a hint, or pass on the word if it's too tough.</p>
                <p>Here's the code for the game's <b>main()</b> function.</p> 
                <p>It creates variables keeping track of how many games have been played, how many rounds have been completed, how many right and wrong answers the player has entered, how many times the player asked for a hint, and creates a history of every word the player has already seen to avoid repeats.</p> 
                <p>It gets the data for these variables from the other functions in this program (not included here).</p>
                <p>Follow along with the <span id="comment">comments</span> I left in the code to see how it works.</p>
